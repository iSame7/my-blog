Engineering leader with over 15 years of experience driving end-to-end mobile product development and cross-platform engineering strategy across sports, streaming, e-commerce, and IoT. I currently lead mobile engineering for Bleacher Report at Warner Bros. Discovery in Amsterdam, where Iâ€™m responsible for scaling high-performance teams, delivering complex initiatives, and aligning technical execution with business priorities.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve built and led engineering teams that ship at scale, shape architecture, and influence product direction. I specialize in bridging mobile and backend, championing platform quality, and fostering inclusive, high-trust cultures that enable people to do their best work. I also partner closely with product, design, data, and business stakeholders to balance user experience, delivery velocity, and long-term technical strategy.

Beyond mobile, I have experience managing backend teams, driving org-wide initiatives, and mentoring senior engineers toward staff and leadership roles. Iâ€™m passionate about creating clarity in ambiguity and building systems that scale with people and products.

ðŸŽ¨ Creative Perspective
Outside of tech, Iâ€™m a self-taught abstract artist. My work, exhibited across Europe, explores minimal forms and emotional nuance through ink and acrylic. I view creativity and systems thinking as deeply interconnected.

ðŸš€ Entrepreneurial Leadership
Iâ€™m also the founder of Hoof, a social-performance platform for football players that combines community, performance tracking, and player development. Building Hoof from the ground up has sharpened my product sense, lean execution skills, and user empathy.

Currently open to conversations around leadership opportunities where I can make a measurable impact at the intersection of engineering, product, and business.
