Born and raised in Egypt, as a kid I wanted to be a professional football player but it turns out I like computers so I became a software Engineer. I studied computer science for 5 years and worked as a software engineer for a couple of companies in Egypt mainly in e-commerce, music, IoT domains. 

In 2014 I built a startup called Beliaa together with a friend in Egypt to solve the car maintenance nightmares by streamlining the communication between car owners, road rescue centers, and automotive workshops.

 I came to the Netherlands in 2016 where I joined Philipse to work in the health department to develop mobile apps connected to devices like Philipse sleep tracking, Philips wake-up light, etc â€¦
Then I joined Tiqets, VanMoof, and Temper where I am a tech lead for their mobile team. 

Outside work I like to play football almost weekly, learn guitar, play chess, reading and discovering music.
